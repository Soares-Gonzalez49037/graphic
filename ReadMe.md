------------
### ASG Graphics Organization, or Andrew Soares Gonzalez Graphics Organization was created March 25,2019. The founder of the organization is Andrew Soares Gonzalez. The organization's purpose is to help graphic designers find work. There are five locations listed in the website. Also, the price of membership fees for students and professionals is listed.  The home page (index.html) has six stock images. The membership fee page (fee.html) has five stock images. The contact us page (contact.html) has two stock images. The about page (about.html) has three stock images. The organization name at the top of the page has the first three letters colored. The color of these letters is red, yellow and blue. These are the primary colors and play into the theme of the website. Also, the organization name ASG Graphics Organization that appears on top of each page, when click, redirects you back to the home page. I made it like this because, the home page answers several questions. Please visit the website for more information.[Home Page](https://soares-gonzalez49037.github.io/graphic/organization/ "Home Page")
